1. WAP to convert a list of tuple into dictionary.
    ```py
    ("C#", 1), ("C", 2), ("C++", 3), ("Go", 20), ("Python", 25), ("Rust", 4)
    ```
2. WAP to find a tuple element by value and print its position.
3. WAP to find the min, max number from the list entered by user.
4. WAP to find the intersect of two lists.
5. WAP to sort the list of integers in descending order and find the sum of all odd numbers in the sorted list.
6. WAP to remove the elements of the list before a specific index.
7. WAP to change the name of key in a dictionary.
8. WAP to multiply all the elements of dictionary.
9. WAP to add values in a set using while loop.
10. WAP program to create a lambda function that adds 15 to a given number passed in as an argument, also create a lambda function that multiplies argument x with argument y and print the result.
11. Use a dictionary comprehension to count the length of each word in sentence 'Practice Problems to Drill List Comprehension in Your Head.'
12. Take 20 integer inputs in list from user and print the following:
    - i. number of positive numbers
    - ii. number of negative numbers
    - iii. number of odd numbers
    - iv. number of even numbers
    - v. number of 0s.
13. Take 10 integer inputs from user and store them in a list. Again ask user to give a number. Now, tell user whether that number is present in list or not.
14. Take one input string and create one list by using all the chars of the string.
15. WAP to replace last value of tuples in a list. 
    ```py
    Sample list: [(10, 20, 40), (40, 50, 60), (70, 80, 90)]
    Expected Output: [(10, 20, 100), (40, 50, 100), (70, 80, 100)]
    ```
16. WAP to calculate the product, multiplying all the numbers of a given tuple.
17. WAP program to compute element-wise sum of given tuples. 
    ```py
    Original lists:
    (1, 2, 3, 4)
    (3, 5, 2, 1)
    (2, 2, 3, 1)
    Element-wise sum of the said tuples:
    (6, 9, 8, 6)
    ```
18. Consider the following tuple and write the code for the following statements:
    ```py
    T1 = (12, 3, 45, 'Hockey', 'Anil', ('a','b'))
        a. Display the first element of 'T1'
        b. Display the last element of 'T1'
        c. Display 'T1' in reverse order.
        d. Display 'Anil' from tuple 'T1'
        e. Display 'b' from tuple 'T1'
    ```
19. WAP to print a dictionary where the keys are numbers between 1 and 15 and the values are square of keys.
20. WAP to get the maximum and minimum value in a dictionary.
21. WAP to create a dictionary from two lists without losing duplicate values.
22. WAP to create union & intersection of sets.
23. WAP to check if a set is a subset of another set
24. WAP to count the frequency of values in a given dictionary:
    ```py
    {'V': 10, 'VI': 10, 'VII': 40, 'VIII': 20, 'IX': 70, 'X': 80, 'XI': 40, 'XII': 20}
    ```
25. WAP to check if two given sets have no elements in common.
